### How to get:
For beginners, we recommend using [SkyClient](https://skyclient.co/), a free and open-sourced mod installer. For more technical users, all of our mods, including [Hytils](https://github.com/Polyfrost/Hytils-Reborn), [CrashPatch](https://github.com/Polyfrost/crashpatch), [EvergreenHUD](https://github.com/Polyfrost/EvergreenHUD), and [Chatting](https://github.com/Polyfrost/chatting) have full support, and come with OneConfig. Mods which use [Vigilance](https://github.com/EssentialGG/Vigilance) are also supported through our [compatability layer](https://docs.polyfrost.cc/oneconfig/config/compatibility).

### Is it a client?
While it may look like OneConfig is a client, in reality it's actually a standalone mod. You can actually [see for yourself](https://github.com/Polyfrost/OneConfig-Bootstrap), it doesn't come with any mods of it's own. It's left up to the user to decide which mods they want to actually use.


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting started
Almost everything you could need to start using OneConfig can be found in [our documentation](https://docs.polyfrost.cc). For further questions, feel free to make a developer ticket in [our discord](https://polyfrost.cc/discord).

- Start a new project with our [mod template](https://github.com/Polyfrost/OneConfigExampleMod/), add OneConfig to an [existing project](https://docs.polyfrost.cc/oneconfig/getting-started), or [migrate](https://docs.polyfrost.cc/oneconfig/config/compatibility) from ``JSON``, ``Vigilance``, or ``.cfg`` (Forge) files.
- [Register a config](https://docs.polyfrost.cc/oneconfig/config/creating-a-config)
- [Add config options](https://docs.polyfrost.cc/oneconfig/config/adding-options)
- [HUD system](https://docs.polyfrost.cc/oneconfig/huds/creating-a-hud)
- Check out other [utilities](https://docs.polyfrost.cc/oneconfig/utils/oneconfigs-utilities) like [events](https://docs.polyfrost.cc/oneconfig/events/event-basics), [commands](https://docs.polyfrost.cc/oneconfig/commands/commands), and [custom rendering](https://docs.polyfrost.cc/oneconfig/gui/render-manager).
