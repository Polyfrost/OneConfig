## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not submit an issue or pull request**: this might reveal the vulnerability.

Instead, you should contact Polyfrost directly at [our discord server](https://polyfrost.org/discord), in a ticket.

We will deal with the vulnerability privately and submit a patch as soon as possible.

You can also submit your vulnerability report to [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?utm_campaign=polyfrost%2Foneconfig&utm_medium=social&utm_source=github&target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpolyfrost%2Foneconfig) and see if you can get a bounty reward.
