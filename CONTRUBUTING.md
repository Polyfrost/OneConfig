# Contributing to OneConfig

OneConfig is developed as an open core product under an [OSI-approved open source license](https://github.com/polyfrost/oneconfig), making the majority of functionality freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. As is typical with open core enterprise features are developed under a non OSI-approved license. Where contributions are not trival ("de minimis") Polyfrost requires contributors to sign a contributors license agreement before we will be able to merge your contribution.

 Transparency is key and as a company Polyfrost strives to be as open about as many things as possible. This refers to both developing OneConfig in the open as well as how developers and staff interact on a personal level with other human beings. We are strong believers in the benefits that an open culture provides. At Polyfrost we are open-minded, inclusive, transparent, and curious. We always remain students of the game, not masters of the game.
