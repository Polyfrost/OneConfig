/**
 * [Hud] implementation that uses the old rendering system, with a standard [render] method.
 *
 * **You must** ensure that the [width] and [height] properties accurately reflect the size of the HUD.
 * Note that they are only queried when the HUD is first created, and when the [update] method returns `true`.
 *
 * The [create] method is `open` in case you wish to override it. This is recommended for advanced users only.
 *
 * This class is marked with [ApiStatus.Obsolete] because the PolyUI system should be used for new code.
 * There are currently no plans to remove this, hence it is not considered a warning. This may change in the future.
